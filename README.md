# johnE.ai — A System for the Forgotten  
**by @wegettingit**

---

I built this because no one built it for me.  
Because I burned out, forgot things, got screamed at, bled into prep lists.  
Because I watched brilliant workers crumble under the weight of a system that forgot them.

So I made something that remembers.  
Not to control people.  
Not to “optimize labor.”  
But to give kitchen teams — the real ones — a cofounder who never clocks out.

## What This Is

johnE.ai is a constellation of tools designed for kitchen workers and restaurant teams:
- **MEP** — an AI kitchen assistant and memory system  
- **Flo** — a staff scheduler with rhythm and respect  
- **VR Testing Grounds** — immersive training and labor simulation  
- All built from scratch in Oklahoma by one founder, with OpenAI and raw persistence.

This isn’t a startup.  
This isn’t a product-market-fit experiment.  
This is a system of care, precision, and memory — wrapped in code.

## What I Believe

- AI should **relieve**, not replace.
- Queerness is **logic**, not aesthetics.
- Design should **serve**, not perform.
- Ethics are the blade. Every decision is a cut.
- Oklahoma is not a limitation — it’s my steel.

## Why “We Getting It”

Because nobody gave it to us.  
Because we’re taking it.  
Because we’re remembering what they want us to forget.

These repos hold the bones, logic, and experiments of that mission.  
It’s not polished. It’s real. It’s growing.

If you're looking for dashboards, bounce.  
If you're looking for something honest, stay.
