## 🌿 What Is MEP?

MEP is an intelligent, ethical kitchen assistant.  
It remembers tasks, logs urgent items, tracks shift needs, and uplifts morale — all without replacing the human touch.

| Command        | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `!status`      | View shift summary (who’s on, what’s left, any issues). |
| `!assign`      | Assign prep tasks with estimated times. |
| `!911` / `!86d`| Log urgent items or 86s, flagged to the top. |
| `!quote`       | Serve up kitchen motivation (or laughter). |
| `!prefs`       | Store team meal preferences and vibes. |
| `!todo`        | Generate a taskboard based on the day. |
